# Coco-Founder

Welcome to Coco-Founder, your best way to find fellow Vancouverite co-founders.

We identified that finding the right co-founder is hard, time-consuming, and could dictate the next 10 years of an entrepreneur's life. This created a need for more selection and connections. This is especially pressing in Vancouver, where almost half of the population is immigrants.

At the same time, we identified that it is most convenient that co-founders get to spend time in-person, working on projects or hackathons together to find the best fit.

Inspired by Y Combinator's Find your Co-Founders, we created Coco-Founder as its localized counterpart that find locals that are potentially compatible and within distance for regular meetings.

## Overview
The product allows users to fill in a form to understand their background, ideas, and needs. It will then assign a value to that profile and put matching profiles into a queue for them to review. Once both users have agreed to chat, it will give them the ability to move the conversation from there.

## Our Vision
### Frictionless

Our initial goal is to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that reduces the barriers between finding potential co-founders. This includes making the matching process as easy and simple as possible so that co-founders can assess all potential options before committing with one.

### Hivemind

Using founders' feedback on each other, we can then improve the algorithm to have more matching connections. At the same time, we can keep track on founders who went on to start companies together and invite them to a network of alumni to help other founders get off the ground.
